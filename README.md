# goodreads-2-notion

Api integration to move your exported library to notion

## Usage

Goodreads api is not open now apparently (see [here](https://help.goodreads.com/s/article/Does-Goodreads-support-the-use-of-APIs)).

The way to obtan your lists is to go to to > `My Books` and then
go to `Import/Export`, then press into `Export Library`.

## Dev

Use this to use node in powershell -> `$env:Path += ";C:\Program Files\nodejs\"`
. From [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19569990).
